# Zachary's *Wyzdom*

Hi! This is a repository for code written for (or during) tutoring sessions. All code is stored in the [Students](./Students/) folder, and labelled by name! 

Additionally, [this page](https://nathansbud.github.io/Wyzdom/) houses links to runnable versions of web-related projects, so that they can be seen without needing to a) download the source code, or b) worry about making changes.
